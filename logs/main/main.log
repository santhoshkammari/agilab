Let me think about how to approach this. They mentioned using tools, so I should check which functions are available. There's async_web_search and scrapling_get.\n\nFirst, async_web_search can perform a Bing search. The parameters are query and max_results. The user's query is straightforward, so I can use this function to search for \\"current weather in London\\" and get the top results. Maybe the first result will have the necessary info. I'll set max_results to 5 just in case, but probably the first one is enough.\n\nAlternatively, scrapling_get makes a GET request to a specific URL. But the user didn't provide a URL, so I might need to use async_web_search first to find a reliable weather website. However, if I can assume a URL for a weather service like Weather.com or BBC Weather, maybe I can use scrapling_get directly. But since the user wants the current weather, it's safer to do a search first to get the latest data. \n\nWait, the functions are separate. The user might not have provided a URL, so using async_web_search is the way to go. Let me structure the tool call with the query \\"current weather in London\\" and max_results as 5. That should fetch the latest weather information from various sources. Then, I can process the results to extract the current temperature and conditions. I don't need to use scrapling_get here unless I have a specific URL, which I don't. So the correct tool to use is async_web_search.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}

Now I need to process these search results to find the current weather information. Let me look at each of the URLs provided.\n\nFirst, AccuWeather has a specific URL for London's current weather. The title mentions \\"Current Weather\\" and the description includes radar and hourly data. That's a good source. The BBC Weather link is also relevant, as they often provide accurate forecasts. The Met Office link has a 7-day forecast, which might include current conditions. The Weather Network's URL is for the current weather, and the last one from Weatherin.org has today's weather and a 14-day forecast.\n\nI should check each of these links to extract the current temperature and conditions. However, since the user might not want me to visit each site, maybe I can infer from the search results. The first result from AccuWeather is likely the most direct. The description mentions \\"current conditions,\\" so I can use that. The BBC link is also a reliable source. But without visiting the sites, I can't be sure of the exact current data. Wait, the tool response only gives the search results, not the actual content. So I need to use the scrapling_get function on each of these URLs to fetch the content and extract the current weather details.\n\nStarting with the first URL: https://www.accuweather.com/en/gb/london/ec4a-2/current-weather/328328. Let me use scrapling_get here. The parameters would be the URL, and maybe set main_content_only to True to get the key info. The extraction_type is markdown by default, but maybe the website uses a specific CSS selector for the current temperature and conditions. If I can't find a selector, I might need to extract the main content and look for keywords like \\"current temperature\\" or \\"today's weather.\\"\n\nNext, the BBC Weather URL: https://www.bbc.com/weather/2643743. This site usually has a clear layout. The main content might have the current temperature and weather summary. Using scrapling_get with main_content_only=True could help here.\n\nThe Met Office link: https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/forecast/gcpvj0v07. Their site might have a different structure. I need to check if the CSS selector for the current weather is available. If not, maybe the main content will have the necessary data.\n\nThe Weather Network's URL: https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/city/gb/greater-london/london/current. This seems to be a direct current weather page. Using scrapling_get here with main_content_only=True should get the current conditions.\n\nWeatherin.org: https://weatherin.org/united-kingdom/england/london. The description mentions today's weather, so maybe the current data is at the top of the page. Again, using scrapling_get with main_content_only=True.\n\nBut the user might want a concise answer. Maybe I can use the first result's URL and extract the current temperature and conditions from there. Let me start with the AccuWeather URL. I'll call scrapling_get on that URL to get the content. Then, look for the temperature and weather description in the extracted text. If that's not possible, I might need to check another source. However, since the user's initial request was to search the web, and the tool response gave me the search results, I need to use the scrapling_get function on one of these URLs to get the actual data. Let me proceed with the first URL.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}

The parameters for the scrapping function include a CSS selector, which might help target the right table. But I don't know the exact CSS selector for the Test scores on his page. Maybe I can use a general approach to find tables related to Test cricket.\n\nThe function provided is scrapling_get. The parameters required are the URL, and optional ones like impersonate, extraction_type, css_selector, main_content_only, timeout, retries, retry_delay. Since the user wants specific data, I should set main_content_only to True to focus on the main part of the page. The extraction_type is default markdown, but maybe using a different type like 'table' would be better if possible. However, the function's description says the extraction_type is a string, but the options aren't specified. Maybe the default is markdown, which might not be the best for tables. Wait, perhaps the function can handle tables if the extraction_type is set to 'table' or something similar. But since the default is markdown, maybe I should check if the content is in markdown format. Alternatively, maybe the function can extract tables automatically if the css_selector points to the table element.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't specify the extraction type, maybe using the css_selector to target the table that contains Test scores. For example, on Wikipedia, player stats are often in a table with a class like 'wikitable' or 'playerstats'. I might need to search for that. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. However, the user might be referring to the career statistics section. Let me think: the Wikipedia page for Virat Kohli has a section titled \\"Career statistics\\" which includes tables for Test, ODI, and T20. The Test table would have columns like Matches, Inns, Runs, etc. So the CSS selector could be something like 'table.wikitable' or more specific if possible.\n\nBut since I don't have the exact CSS selector, maybe the best approach is to fetch the entire page content and then look for the relevant table. However, the function has a parameter 'main_content_only' which is True by default. That might help in getting the main content where the stats are. Alternatively, maybe the function can extract all tables and I can process them. Wait, the function's return is a dict with status, content, and url. The content is the extracted text. If the extraction_type is markdown, maybe the tables are rendered as markdown tables. But I need to make sure that the function can capture the table data properly.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should first perform an async web search to find the exact URL of Virat Kohli's Wikipedia page, just to be certain. But I think the URL is straightforward. Alternatively, if there's a chance the user might have a different page in mind, like a different language version, but the default is English, so probably the correct one.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by using the scrapling_get function with the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli, set main_content_only to True, and maybe use a CSS selector to target the specific table. If I can't find the exact selector, the function might return the main content which includes the table. Alternatively, if the table is in a specific section, like under a div with a certain id, but I don't know that. Let me try using the CSS selector for tables. Maybe 'table' as the selector to get all tables, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, if the table has a class like 'playerstats', but I need to check. However, since I can't do that, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nWait, perhaps the user just wants the latest Test scores or all-time. The question is a bit ambiguous, but the function can extract the content, and then I can process it. So the first step is to fetch the content of the Wikipedia page. Let me structure the tool call with the URL and parameters. I'll use the scrapping function to get the content, set main_content_only to True, and maybe use a CSS selector that targets the relevant table. If I can't find the exact selector, the function will return the main content which might include the table. Then I can parse the content to find the Test scores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'extraction_type' can be set to 'table' to extract tables specifically. But the function's parameters don't specify that. The default is markdown, which might include tables. Let me check the function definition again. The 'extraction_type' is a string, default 'markdown'. So perhaps the function can extract tables as markdown. Therefore, I'll use the URL, set main_content_only to True, and maybe use a CSS selector that points to the specific table. But without knowing the exact selector, maybe it's better to just get the main content and then look for the Test table in the text.\n\nSo, the tool call would be to scrapling_get with the URL, main_content_only=True, and maybe css_selector='table' to get all tables. Alternatively, if the function's default extraction is markdown, which includes tables, then just fetching the main content might be sufficient. Let me proceed with that. The user might need the latest data, so the function should retrieve the current content of the page. Once the content is retrieved, I can parse it to find the Test scores. But since the user is asking for the scores, I need to make sure that the function can extract that part. Maybe the function will return the entire main content, which includes the table, and then I can process it. But I need to call the function first to get the data.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}

Hmm, maybe the extraction_type parameter doesn't accept \\"table\\" as a valid option. Let me check the function definition again.\n\nLooking back, the scrapling_get function's extraction_type is described as a string with a default of \\"markdown\\". The user might have intended to extract a table, but the function might not support that specific extraction type. So, perhaps I should adjust the parameters. Maybe the extraction_type should be \\"markdown\\" instead, and then I can look for the table within the markdown content.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSS selector is too broad or incorrect. The \\"wikitable\\" class is commonly used for tables on Wikipedia, so that part might be okay. But if the extraction_type is not valid, the function might not be able to process the table correctly. Let me try changing the extraction_type to \\"markdown\\" and see if that works. Then, I can parse the markdown content to find the relevant table section.\n\nAnother possibility is that the function requires a different approach.

The user asked for Virat Kohli's Test scores from his Wikipedia page. I first tried using the scrapling_get function with extraction_type set to \\"table\\", but it gave an error saying that \\"table\\" is an unknown extraction type. So I changed the extraction_type to \\"markdown\\" and tried again. The response this time had some content, but it looks like it's listing awards he's won, not his Test scores.\n\nWait, the content retrieved is about awards like ICC ODI Player of the Year and Test Player of the Year. The user probably wanted his batting statistics, like runs scored, centuries, etc., in Test matches. Maybe the CSS selector I used was incorrect. The \\"wikitable\\" class is common for tables on Wikipedia, but perhaps the specific table for his Test scores has a different class or is located in a different section.\n\nLet me check the structure of the Wikipedia page. Typically, player statistics are in a section titled \\"Career statistics\\" or \\"Test cricket statistics\\". The awards section is separate. So maybe I need to adjust the CSS selector to target that specific section. Alternatively, maybe the function isn't able to extract the tables properly with the current parameters. \n\nI should try a different approach. Maybe search for the exact section using a more specific CSS selector. For example, if the Test stats are in a table under a div with a certain id or class. But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky. Another option is to use the async_web_search function to find the exact URL of the Test statistics section or to look for a specific table on the page. However, since the user mentioned the Wikipedia page, I should stick to scraping that page.\n\nWait, the initial tool call might have fetched the wrong table. The awards table is probably not the one with his scores. Let me think: the user might need the \\"Test\\" section's table. Maybe the CSS selector should be more specific, like targeting a table that's inside a div with a class related to statistics. Alternatively, maybe the function can extract all tables and I can parse the content to find the relevant one. But the previous response only returned the awards table. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \\"main_content_only\\" parameter is excluding the actual stats table. Maybe I should set that to false to get more content. Or maybe the URL is correct, but the selector is wrong. Let me try using a different CSS selector, such as \\"table\\" without specifying the class, to see if that captures the right table. But the user might need the latest data, so I need to ensure the correct table is extracted. \n\nWait, the user might not have specified the exact format, but the initial answer didn't provide the scores. Maybe the function isn't able to extract the table properly. Let me try again with a different CSS selector, maybe targeting the section where the stats are. For example, if the Test stats are in a table with a specific ID or class. Alternatively, maybe the function's default extraction is not sufficient, and I need to adjust parameters again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's query is ambiguous. Are they looking for his career Test scores or specific matches? But the initial answer didn't get that data. Maybe I need to use a different tool or approach. Since the async_web_search is available, maybe I can search for \\"Virat Kohli Test cricket statistics\\" to find the exact page or table. But the user specified the Wikipedia page, so I should focus on that. \n\nHmm, maybe the first tool call was correct, but the extraction_type was set to \\"markdown\\" which isn't the right format. Wait, the user's second tool call used \\"markdown\\" and got the awards table. Maybe the actual Test scores are in a different table on the same page. Let me try to adjust the CSS selector to target a different table, perhaps one that includes \\"Test\\" in the class or id. For example, \\"table#Test\\" or \\"table.player-stats\\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the main content only includes the awards section, and the actual stats are in another part of the page. I might need to fetch the entire page content without limiting to main content. Let me try setting main_content_only to false and see if that captures more tables. But I need to make sure the function can handle that. \n\nWait, the user's second tool call had main_content_only set to true, which might have excluded the stats table. Let me try disabling that to get all content. Also, maybe the CSS selector should be more specific. I'll attempt another tool call with these adjustments.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}
