Let me think about how to approach this. They mentioned using tools, so I should check which functions are available. There's async_web_search and scrapling_get.\n\nFirst, async_web_search can perform a Bing search. The parameters are query and max_results. The user's query is straightforward, so I can use this function to search for \\"current weather in London\\" and get the top results. Maybe the first result will have the necessary info. I'll set max_results to 5 just in case, but probably the first one is enough.\n\nAlternatively, scrapling_get makes a GET request to a specific URL. But the user didn't provide a URL, so I might need to use async_web_search first to find a reliable weather website. However, if I can assume a URL for a weather service like Weather.com or BBC Weather, maybe I can use scrapling_get directly. But since the user wants the current weather, it's safer to do a search first to get the latest data. \n\nWait, the functions are separate. The user might not have provided a URL, so using async_web_search is the way to go. Let me structure the tool call with the query \\"current weather in London\\" and max_results as 5. That should fetch the latest weather information from various sources. Then, I can process the results to extract the current temperature and conditions. I don't need to use scrapling_get here unless I have a specific URL, which I don't. So the correct tool to use is async_web_search.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}

Now I need to process these search results to find the current weather information. Let me look at each of the URLs provided.\n\nFirst, AccuWeather has a specific URL for London's current weather. The title mentions \\"Current Weather\\" and the description includes radar and hourly data. That's a good source. The BBC Weather link is also relevant, as they often provide accurate forecasts. The Met Office link has a 7-day forecast, which might include current conditions. The Weather Network's URL is for the current weather, and the last one from Weatherin.org has today's weather and a 14-day forecast.\n\nI should check each of these links to extract the current temperature and conditions. However, since the user might not want me to visit each site, maybe I can infer from the search results. The first result from AccuWeather is likely the most direct. The description mentions \\"current conditions,\\" so I can use that. The BBC link is also a reliable source. But without visiting the sites, I can't be sure of the exact current data. Wait, the tool response only gives the search results, not the actual content. So I need to use the scrapling_get function on each of these URLs to fetch the content and extract the current weather details.\n\nStarting with the first URL: https://www.accuweather.com/en/gb/london/ec4a-2/current-weather/328328. Let me use scrapling_get here. The parameters would be the URL, and maybe set main_content_only to True to get the key info. The extraction_type is markdown by default, but maybe the website uses a specific CSS selector for the current temperature and conditions. If I can't find a selector, I might need to extract the main content and look for keywords like \\"current temperature\\" or \\"today's weather.\\"\n\nNext, the BBC Weather URL: https://www.bbc.com/weather/2643743. This site usually has a clear layout. The main content might have the current temperature and weather summary. Using scrapling_get with main_content_only=True could help here.\n\nThe Met Office link: https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/forecast/gcpvj0v07. Their site might have a different structure. I need to check if the CSS selector for the current weather is available. If not, maybe the main content will have the necessary data.\n\nThe Weather Network's URL: https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/city/gb/greater-london/london/current. This seems to be a direct current weather page. Using scrapling_get here with main_content_only=True should get the current conditions.\n\nWeatherin.org: https://weatherin.org/united-kingdom/england/london. The description mentions today's weather, so maybe the current data is at the top of the page. Again, using scrapling_get with main_content_only=True.\n\nBut the user might want a concise answer. Maybe I can use the first result's URL and extract the current temperature and conditions from there. Let me start with the AccuWeather URL. I'll call scrapling_get on that URL to get the content. Then, look for the temperature and weather description in the extracted text. If that's not possible, I might need to check another source. However, since the user's initial request was to search the web, and the tool response gave me the search results, I need to use the scrapling_get function on one of these URLs to get the actual data. Let me proceed with the first URL.\n</think>\n\n\"}]"}

The user asked for the current weather in London, and I did a search which gave me several URLs. Then I tried to scrape the first one, AccuWeather, but the content seems a bit messy. There's a lot of navigation links and some repeated sections. The actual weather data might be in there, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nLooking at the content, there's a line that says \\"8\u00b0C\\" and \\"Mostly cloudy\\" under the \\"Current Weather\\" section.

Humidity is 90%, and the dew point is 6\u00b0C. Pressure is 1011 mb, which is decreasing. Visibility is 10 km, and the cloud ceiling is 100 meters. \n\nThere's also a mention of a brief shower or two this evening followed by a little rain late. The probability of precipitation is 89%, and thunderstorms have an 18% chance. The temperature history shows today's high was 8\u00b0C and low 5\u00b0C. The featured stories include some recent weather events, but the main content is about London's current weather.\n\nI need to extract the key points: current temperature, condition, RealFeel, wind speed, humidity, and any precipitation details. The user might want a concise summary. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other important data from the other URLs, but since the first one has the most direct info, I'll focus on that. The other links like BBC and Met Office might have similar data, but without scraping them, I can't be sure. However, the available content from AccuWeather gives a good snapshot. I'll present the current temperature and conditions, mention the RealFeel, wind, humidity, and the chance of rain later.\n</think>\n\nThe current weather in London is **8\u00b0C** with **Mostly cloudy** conditions. The RealFeel\u00ae temperature is **2\u00b0C**, indicating it feels quite cold. Wind is blowing from the south at **21 km/h** with gusts up to **39 km/h**, and humidity is at **90%**.
