PARALLEL AGENTS ARCHITECTURE
============================

YOU: "Build a login system"
  ↓
Root Planner reads codebase → "Too big, splitting"
  → Spawns Subplanner A (UI) + Subplanner B (Auth)

Subplanner A reads codebase → "Manageable, spawning workers"
  → Spawns Worker 1 (buttons) + Worker 2 (text fields)

Worker 1: codes button → finds color system missing
  → Commits to Git
  → Sends handoff to Subplanner A ⬆️

Worker 2: codes text fields → also uses hardcoded colors
  → Commits to Git
  → Sends handoff to Subplanner A ⬆️

Subplanner A reads both handoffs → "Color system needed"
  → Spawns Worker 3 (color system)
  → Worker 3 codes it, commits, sends handoff ⬆️
  → Subplanner A now satisfied → sends summary handoff to Root Planner ⬆️

Subplanner B: spawns Worker 4 (login API) + Worker 5 (sessions)
  → Worker 5 discovers cookie conflict
  → Sends handoff to Subplanner B ⬆️
  → Subplanner B sends summary to Root Planner ⬆️

Root Planner sees everything:
  → "Cookie conflict found by auth team — spawning Subplanner C to fix it"
  →> Loop continues... in parallel.
