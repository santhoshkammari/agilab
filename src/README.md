# Agilab

> A comprehensive software engineering platform with AI-powered tools for modern development workflows.

## Overview

Agilab is an ambitious project aimed at saturating the software engineering domain with AI capabilities. Our platform integrates cutting-edge technologies to assist developers throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

## Our Goals

### Main Goal
**Saturate software engineering with AI capabilities** - Transform how software is built, tested, and maintained through intelligent automation.

### Core Focus Areas

- **Logger** - *Completed*
  - Comprehensive logging infrastructure for tracking development processes
  - Detailed activity monitoring and analysis

- **DeepResearch** - *In Progress*
  - Advanced research capabilities using AI agents
  - Automated literature review and knowledge synthesis

- **LLM Integration** - *In Progress*
  - Multi-model support for various development tasks
  - Seamless integration with different LLM providers

- **Agent Systems** - *Planned*
  - Autonomous development agents for code generation
  - Collaborative AI systems for complex problem solving

- **Coding Assistance** - *Planned*
  - Intelligent code completion and refactoring
  - Automated bug detection and fixing

- **Evaluations** - *Planned*
  - Automated testing and evaluation frameworks
  - Performance benchmarking and optimization

- **Synthetic Data** - *Planned*
  - AI-generated test data and scenarios
  - Simulation environments for software testing

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple specialized modules:

### [Claude](./claude)

### [Scout](./scout)
Optimized search and research capabilities with multi-provider LLM support.

### Spotlight
(Coming soon) Code analysis and optimization tools.

### STS
(Coming soon) Software testing and simulation framework.

## Current Status

- **Completed**: Logger module
- **Active Development**: DeepResearch, LLM Integration
- **Planning Phase**: Agent Systems, Coding Assistance, Evaluations, Synthetic Data

## Vision

We're building a complete ecosystem where AI agents work alongside developers to:
- Accelerate development processes
- Improve code quality and maintainability
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Enhance decision-making through data-driven insights
- Reduce time-to-market for software products

## Contributing
