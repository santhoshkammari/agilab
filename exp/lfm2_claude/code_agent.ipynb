      "*   **Prompt Construction:** The `print_clean` function formats the output to display a clean, human-readable prompt.\n",

      "*   **File Reading:** The `read_file` function attempts to open and read the specified file. If the file doesn't exist or there's an I/O error, it returns an appropriate error message.\n",
      "*   **Tool Execution:** The `execute_tool_call` function searches for a pattern matching `<tool_call_start>` followed by `<tool_call_end>` to identify a tool call. It then processes the generated output based on the tool's signature.\n",
      "*   **Prompt Construction:** The `print_clean` function formats the output to display a clean, human-readable prompt.\n",
      "*   **Tool Call Handling:** The script iterates through a list of tool calls, applying them to the model's input and generating responses. It prints each tool call's description, the generated output, and a summary of the response.\n",
      "*   **Output Formatting:** The script handles cases where no tool calls are found, displaying a final response summarizing the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Output (hypothetical):**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "💬 Reading main.py and summarizing...\n",
      "💬 User: Read main.py and summarize\n",
      "💬 Tool call: <\\|tool_call_start\\| (12345) <\\|tool_call_end\\|>\n",
      "✅ Tool result: This model generated a summary of the input text. The generated output is truncated to 100 characters.\n",

      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error handling, but you might want to expand it to handle specific exceptions more gracefully (e.g., file not found errors, tokenization issues).\n",
      "*   **Tool Support:** The current implementation supports `read_file` and `write_file`. You'll need to add support for other tools by modifying the `execute_tool_call` function to recognize their patterns.\n",
      "*   **Prompt Customization:** The prompt formatting is very basic. You could customize it further to make the conversation more engaging.\n",
      "*   **Input Validation:** The script assumes the input file is in the correct format (`main.py`). You might want to add checks to ensure the file exists before attempting to read it.\n",
